						body: [
							"Milk rounds, paper rounds, second hand shop/market arbitrage, estate fencing (not estate fencing, lol, you know what I mean), then ran a Sunday/seasonal market stall from 14-17, hustler-kid.",
							"Built databases and spreadsheets (mostly Lotus and DOS tabbers, smart sheets, MS Access, some Oracle) for local businesses, built a freelance client base fixing the millenium bug and shipping ~£99 websites",
							"Earned a middling degree from an okay uni (the course was actually pretty useful, almost polytechnic), failed to join the RAF, but found a decent first year real™ job doing VB and early C# near Manchester",
							"Got a better job for a large management consultancy, and enjoyed travelling the country (some overseas, including on the Palm Jumeirah and some skyscrapers in Dubai) fixing problems for large infrastructure projects",
							"Worked on Edinburgh tram, East London line, the UK's flood warning system, and various boring infrastructure projects (mostly custom software solutions, tool/workflow integrations, some clever-clogs stuff, mostly 'big team' stuff). Won some internal awards, but wasn't really anywhere more technical to _go_ (no interest in going into management), and corpo work moves painfully slowly as staff numbers grow.",
							"Left to work for myself and build software around Manchester. Mainly web and mobile apps, tools, games, some cool experiments/prototypes for local start-ups",
							"You can use code I worked on the NICE BNF (British National Formulary) or HDAS (Healthcare Databases Advanced Search) tools, or by using the app for whoever does your smart light bulbs or your phone provider's usage tracker, or by playing Video Poker, Keno or various other casino games in the back of seedy bars or on cruise ships",
							"Side-lined into Microstock photography and passive income (I sell quite a lot of t-shirts online) between contracts, built picWorkflow and related tools with modest user bases. Travelled to Moscow, Berlin and Dublin giving talks on industry/tech until Brexit and the choking of that industry",
							"I pick up a contract occasionally nowadays, but I'm picky about what takes up time I could be using for my own work. I just really love building things.",
							"Currently I'm enjoying learning what AI can and can't do. I don't really have any conclusions yet."

					{
						title: "FAQ",
						body: [
							"Q: Are you available for work?",
							"A: Sometimes. I'm probably not very interested in your stack though, the cloud-first stuff is more admin than interesting code.",
							"Q: What do you build?",
							"A: Web apps, tools, games, toys, whatever. Most of my stuff would fall under production tool nowadays",
							"Q: Why the Commodore 64 look?",
							"A: I got bored of the usual corpo themes and I like anti-design",
